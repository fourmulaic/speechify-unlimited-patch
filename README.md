# Speechify Unlimited Patch

# What is Speechify

Speechify is a mobile and desktop app that reads any text aloud using a computer generated text to speech voice. The app is notable for producing near-human quality voices, and for using optical character recognition technology to turn physical books or any printed text into audio.

**This patch only works for Speechify Chrome extension.**
